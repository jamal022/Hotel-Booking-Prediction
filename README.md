# Hotel Booking Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the status of hotel bookings, specifically whether a booking will be canceled or not. Various machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and more, are applied to achieve this goal. The project also encompasses data cleaning and filtering methods to ensure the quality and accuracy of the analysis.

## Project Files

The project repository contains the following files:

- `ML_hotel_booking_Prediction_deploy.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that guides you through the process of data preprocessing, model development, and prediction. You can explore this notebook to understand the project's workflow and findings.

- `data_dictionary.txt`: A text file that provides a data dictionary, offering explanations and descriptions of the dataset's attributes. This is a valuable resource for understanding the dataset's features.

- `hotel_bookings.csv`: The dataset used for this project. It contains information related to hotel bookings and serves as the foundation for predictive modeling.

## Usage

1. Begin with the `ML_hotel_booking_Prediction_deploy.ipynb` notebook, which will guide you through the project's workflow.

2. Refer to `data_dictionary.txt` to better understand the dataset attributes and their meanings.

3. Utilize the `hotel_bookings.csv` dataset for analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
